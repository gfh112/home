excerpt: 'We carry out the first dynamical evoultion prediction of TDEs based on state-of-the-art GRRMHD simulations in this paper. The observed temperature, luminosity, optical to X-ray luminosity ratio, and radius of various TDEs fall within the predicted range of our model and to first order the evolution of these parameters are consistent with the model as well.'
