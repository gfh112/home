title: "An asymmetric electron-scattering photosphere around optical tidal disruption events"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/polarisation_TDE
excerpt: 'I am one of the co-authors. In the paper, we present the first observed polarization data of TDEs and find the line polarisation levels are in agreement with an axis symetric thick envelope of free electrons extending 1000s of gravitational radii.'
