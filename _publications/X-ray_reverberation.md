collection: publications
permalink: /publications/X-ray_reverberation
excerpt: 'In this paper, we investigate the theoretical X-ray reverberation signal produced in a super-Eddington accretion setting and compare it to the standard thin disk. We also show a X-ray reverberation on a super-Eddington geometry explains the observation of the jetted TDE, Swift J1644+57, better than the disk.

In this paper, we investigate the theoretical X-ray reverberation signal produced in a super-Eddington accretion setting and compare it to the standard thin disk. We also show a X-ray reverberation on a super-Eddington geometry explains the observation of the jetted TDE, Swift J1644+57, better than the disk.
